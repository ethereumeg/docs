The emergence of the community is divided into three stages (I.-III.):

## Stage I. - pre-genesis
At this stage nothing is certain, it is a stage of ideation and thinking.

The initiative will be widely discussed within Q2/2023 on [EthereumZurich](https://ethereumzuri.ch/) and [ETHDam](https://www.ethdam.com/), and hopefully published on [ETHPrague](https://ethprague.com/), early June 2023 (genesis).

### At this stage, we are mainly addressing the following areas

- Inviting the [founding gardeners](/en/founders)
- Defining the [key objectives](/en/goals)
- Finalisation of our [Manifesto](/en/manifesto)
- Establishing a community platform, such as a [forum](http://ethevents.club/) or [chat application](https://t.me/EthereumEG), to facilitate communication and collaboration among members

## Stage II. - community-bootstrap

In this stage, we focus on the further development of the community and its infrastructure. Our main objective is to create an environment where individuals can contribute, collaborate, and grow together.

### Activities in this stage include:

- Launching educational resources and workshops to help newcomers understand the ecosystem and its objectives
- Organizing meetups, hackathons, and other events to engage members and promote knowledge sharing
- Developing governance mechanisms and voting systems to ensure community participation in decision-making
- Implementing incentives and rewards to encourage contributions from community members
- Encouraging community-led initiatives and projects, with support from the founding team as needed

## Stage III. - road to decentralization

The final stage of the community's emergence is focused on achieving true decentralization. This means empowering the community to take ownership of the ecosystem and its resources, as well as ensuring that no single entity has control over its direction.

### Key aspects of this stage include:

- Transitioning control of core infrastructure, such as the platform and its assets, to decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) governed by community members
- Establishing clear guidelines and processes for proposing, discussing, and implementing changes to the ecosystem
- Ensuring the sustainability of the ecosystem through decentralized funding models, such as tokenomics and community treasury management
- Continuously refining and iterating on the governance model to adapt to the needs of the growing community

By completing these three stages, we aim to create a strong, decentralized community that fosters collaboration and innovation, while staying true to our core values and objectives.
