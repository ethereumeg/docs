title: "Boostrapping stages"

The emergence of the community is divided into three stages (I.-III.):

## Stage I. - pre-genesis
At this stage nothing is certain, it is a stage of ideation and thinking.

The initiative will be widely discussed within Q2/2023 on [EthereumZurich](https://ethereumzuri.ch/) and [ETHDam](https://www.ethdam.com/), and hopefully published on [ETHPrague](https://ethprague.com/), early June 2023 (genesis).

### At this stage, we are mainly addressing the following areas

- Inviting the [founding gardeners](/en/founders)
- Defining the [key objectives](/en/goals)
- Finalisation of our [Manifesto](/en/manifesto)
- Setting up basic communication tools

## Stage II. - community-bootstrap
TODO

## Stage III. - road to decentralization
TODO
