**Manifesto of Ethereum Event Gardeners**

> In the sprawling landscape of *[the Infinite Garden](https://ethereum.foundation/infinitegarden)*, we stand as a group of nonconformist, working to cultivate and nurture the Ethereum community. We are a diverse assembly of individuals from different fields and backgrounds, united by our passion for decentralized technologies and human coordination.
> 
> Our mission is to promote and support community events and gatherings, and to foster a culture of inclusivity, diversity, and open participation. Embrace the unique local characteristics of every corner of the world, and celebrate the voluntary work that is done with meaning and purpose.
>
> We stand in opposition to commercialization and unification, rejecting the notion that our community should be homogenized and commoditized. Instead, we strive to create a decentralized and grassroots movement that highlights the differences and diversity of our global community.
>
> As a group of people with cypherpunk in our hearths, we cherish the basic principles of freedom and collaboration that underlie Ethereum. Our diverse membership, comprising both solarpunks and lunarpunks, brings a range of perspectives and energies to our mission. 
> 
> Let us sow the seeds of a vibrant and inclusive community, one that will bloom and flourish for generations to come.
>
> *Your Ethereum Event Gardeners*
