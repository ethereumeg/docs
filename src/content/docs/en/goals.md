The Ethereum Event Gardeners recognize the importance of community events in fostering collaboration, innovation, and growth within the Ethereum ecosystem. We aim to support and enhance the impact of such events by promoting the values of diversity, inclusivity, and open participation.

## Key areas

### Collect, Archive and Publish Information

One of our primary goals is to collect, archive and publish information about Ethereum community events. By doing so, we aim to create a centralized hub of knowledge that can be easily accessed by anyone interested in the Ethereum community. This includes hackathons, conferences, meetups, and other gatherings. We believe that having a central repository of information can help create a better understanding of the community's history and its growth over time.

### Improve the Culture of Events

The Ethereum community is known for its openness and inclusivity. As Ethereum Event Gardeners, we aim to promote and enhance these values at community events. We believe that a diverse and inclusive community is essential for innovation and growth. We strive to create an environment where everyone can participate, share ideas, and learn from each other. We aim to create a culture where everyone is welcome, regardless of their background or level of expertise.

### Support Organizers

Organizing an event is a daunting task, especially for those who are new to the process. As Ethereum Event Gardeners, we aim to support organizers by providing communication space, resources, tools, and best practice guidance. We believe that by providing support to organizers, we can help create successful and impactful events that benefit the entire Ethereum community.

### Coordinate with Other Ethereum Groups

The Ethereum ecosystem is vast and includes various groups, such as AllCoreDevs/Ethereum Cat Herders, Ethereum Magicians, EF, etc. As Ethereum Event Gardeners, we aim to coordinate with these groups to ensure that our efforts are aligned and complementary. By working together, we can create a more cohesive and collaborative community that is better equipped to tackle the challenges facing the Ethereum ecosystem.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the Ethereum Event Gardeners' vision is to create a vibrant and inclusive community that fosters innovation, collaboration, and growth. We believe that by promoting diversity, inclusivity, and open participation, we can create an environment where everyone can thrive. Through our efforts to collect and publish information, improve the culture of events, support organizers, and coordinate with other Ethereum groups, we aim to make a meaningful contribution to the Ethereum ecosystem.
